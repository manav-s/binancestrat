# Binance Trading Algorithm
### This project involves the creation of an automated trading algorithm for Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The algorithm is specifically designed for the BTC-USD pair and is based on a backtested, long-only strategy. The hypothesis underpinning the strategy is that low returns and a decrease in trading volume signal a price increase.

## Highlights
- Backtested long-only hypothesis for BTC-USD where low returns and decrease in trading volume signal price increase.
- Automated trading algorithm hosted on a virtual EC2 server in the AWS console for enhanced stability and remote access.
- Streamed real-time and historical (from Q4 2017) cryptocurrency data with Binance API.
- Leveraged data visualization tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook for in-depth analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- AWS EC2
- Binance API
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
